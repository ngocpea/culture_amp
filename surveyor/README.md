Culture Amp Survey Coding Challenge Attempt
---
DESCRIPTION: 
- Code for an (imaginary) gem called "Surveyor", which helps represent survey data within Ruby
- Two main sub-directories: spec and lib.
---
ENVIRONMENTS
- ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26) [x86_64-linux-gnu]
---
SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES & CONFIGURATION
- Installation of rspec gem > gem install rspec [3.6]
- Installation of rubocop > gem install rubocop [0.50.0]
---
APPLICATION INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
- No installation required. Unzip file and cd into Surveyor
---
TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Rspec was used for testing > bundle exec rspec from surveyor folder to check all
- Rubocop used for syntax checking > $rubocop [filename]
---
DELIVERABLES: 
- Source files with code to make tests pass

Logic points: 
- Looking at the tests first to see what is required and working backwards to try and think logically as to how to make the tests pass.
- Using error messages to debug 

Challenges: 
- To make code as dynamic as possible rather than hardcoding which was my initial approach which would mean the tests would fail if the requirements changed slightly. 
- Logiacal thinking > definitely needs to be practiced. 
- Some Rubocop suggestions i.e. each over for loop, struggled with making code pass tests after using each loop.
